### Hey there! I'm Mathias Pepin-Leduc, I am 20 y.o and aspired to become a Java, Rust and TypeScript programmer.
*I use Arch btw*

### My projects
- **[Exvoid Network](https://github.com/ExvoidNet)**, a Canadian-french multiplayer games hosting community that I own and operate.
- **[Feedbacky](https://github.com/feedbacky-project)**, a free software for collecting feedback in which I am moderating and documenting.
